            <h1>For Sosh Sellers</h1>

            <p>Sosh is a marketplace that lets you promote your products all across Canada. We want to make sure that both you and your buyers have a great experience on Sosh. Read on to learn more about your rights as a seller, and also what is required of you as a seller.</p>

            <h4>This policy is a part of our Terms of Service. By creating a Sosh Sellers account and releasing products, you’re agreeing to this policy.</h4>

            <h2>1. How Sosh Works</h2>
            <p>Sosh works as a marketplace app that lets users shop socially. If Sosh users decide to purchase your product, they get directed to your product website. This means that your orders aren’t fulfilled from the Sosh Sellers Platform, but instead your product website and infrastructure that already exists. By releasing your products on Sosh, you get to advertise your product in-front of potential buyers.</p>

            <h2>2. What Can be Sold on Sosh</h2>
            <p>Sosh is a unique marketplace. Buyers come here to mainly shop fashion items and clothing with friends. Products that can be sold on Sosh are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Clothing</li>
                <li>Footwear</li>
                <li>Jewelry and Accessories</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Creating and Uploading Content</h2>
            <p>As a member of Sosh, you have the opportunity to create and upload a variety of content, like listings, Messages, text, photos, and videos. In order to keep our community safe and respectful, you agree that you will not upload content that is:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Abusive, threatening, defamatory, or harassing;</li>
                <li>Obscene, pornographic, or vulgar;</li>
                <li>In violation of someone else’s privacy or intellectual property rights or</li>
                <li>False, deceptive, or misleading.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>4. Representing Yourself, Your Shop, and Your Listings Honestly</h2>
            <p>At Sosh, we value transparency. Transparency means that you honestly and accurately represent your brand and your products.
                By selling on Sosh, you agree that you will:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Provide honest, accurate information in your account data.</li>
                <li>Honour your shop policies.</li>
                <li>Accurately represent your items in listings and listing photos.</li>
                <li>Respect the intellectual property of others. If you feel someone has violated your intellectual property rights, you can report it to us.</li>
                <li>Not engage in fee avoidance.</li>
                <li>Not create duplicate shops or take any other action (such as manipulating clicks, carts or sales) for the purpose of manipulating search or circumventing Sosh’s policies.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>5. Privacy and Protecting Personal Information</h2>
            <p>You are responsible for protecting members’ personal information you receive or process, and you must comply with all relevant legal requirements. This includes applicable data protection and privacy laws that govern the ways in which you can use your buyers information. These laws may require that you post and comply with your own privacy policy, which must be accessible to Sosh users with whom you interact. Your privacy policy must be compatible with this policy.</p>
            <p>In particular, when you sell using our Services (subject to this Policy), you may receive and determine what to do with certain personal information, such as when communicating with users and entering into transactions with buyers. This means you process personal information (for example, buyer name, email address, and delivery address) and, to the extent you do so, under EU law, you are an independent controller of data relating to other users that you may have obtained through the Services.</p>
            <p>You are responsible for protecting user personal information you receive or process and complying with all relevant legal requirements when you use the Services. This includes applicable data protection and privacy laws that govern the ways in which you can use a user’s information. Such laws may require that you post, and comply with, your own privacy policy, which must be accessible to Sosh users you interact with and compatible with this policy. For more information on the General Data Protection Regulation, see more resources at https://gdpr-info.eu and http://gdprandyou.ie.</p>
            
            <p>If Sosh and you are found to be joint data controllers of personal information, and if Sosh is sued, fined, or otherwise incurs expenses because of something that you did in your capacity as a joint data controller of buyer personal information, you agree to indemnify Sosh for the expenses it occurs in connection with your processing of buyer personal information.</p>

            <h2>6. Providing Great Customer Service</h2>
            <p>We expect our sellers to provide a high level of customer service. By selling on Sosh, you agree to:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Honour your dispatch and processing times. Sellers are obligated to dispatch an item or otherwise complete a transaction with a buyer in a prompt manner, unless there is an exceptional circumstance.</li>
                <li>Respond to Messages in a timely manner.</li>
                <li>Honour the commitments you make in your shops policy.</li>
                <li>Resolve disagreements or disputes directly with the buyer. In the unlikely event that you can’t reach a resolution, our Dispute Resolution team can help through our case system.</li>
                <li>If you are unable to complete an order, you must notify the buyer and cancel the order.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>As a seller, you must provide great customer service and maintain trust with your buyers. These requirements are called our Seller Service Standards.</p>
            
            <h2>7. Responding to Requests for Cancellations, Returns, and Exchanges</h2>
            <p>Please be aware that in addition to this policy, each country has its own laws surrounding delivery, cancellations, returns and exchanges. Please familiarise yourself with the laws of your own country and those of your buyers’ countries.</p>
            
            <h2>8. Cancellations</h2>
            <p>If you are unable to complete a transaction, you must notify the buyer via email and cancel the transaction. If the buyer already submitted payment, you must issue a full refund. You are encouraged to keep proof of any refunds in the event a dispute arises.</p>
            
            <h2>9. European Union Right of Withdrawal</h2>
            <p>Buyers in the European Union (EU) may be entitled to a 14-day “right of withdrawal” after receiving an item, during which they may return an item for any reason. The details of this right vary by EU member state. The right of withdrawal does not apply to custom items or certain perishable goods. Rights with respect to digital items vary by EU member state. </p>
            
            <h2>10. Sosh’s Case System</h2>
            <p>We ask buyers to contact sellers directly and attempt to resolve any outstanding issues before opening a case on Sosh. For this reason, it is important that you fill out your shop policies and regularly respond to messages from your buyers.</p>
            <p>Buyers may file a case for a non-delivery or a not-as-described item. You must respond to any open cases within three days or the time frame noted by Sosh in the case. Sosh may request your assistance in resolving a case opened against your shop. Sosh reserves the right to escalate a case early for circumstances such as seller inactivity, harassment, refusal of service, case manipulation, and undermining the integrity of the case system.</p>
            <p>By using Sosh’s case system, you understand that Sosh may use your personal information for the purpose of resolving disputes with other members. Cases can be filed in the following circumstances:</p>
            <h3>Non-Delivery</h3>
            <p>A non-delivery occurs when a buyer places an order but does not receive the item. The following are examples of non-delivery cases:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>There is no proof that the item was dispatched by the seller.</li>
                <li>An item was not sent to the correct address.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Not as Described</h3>
            <p>An item is not as described if the buyer can demonstrate that it is significantly different from your listing description or your photos. The following are examples of not as described cases:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The item received is a different colour, model, version, or size.</li>
                <li>The item has a different design or material.</li>
                <li>The seller failed to disclose that an item is damaged or is missing parts.</li>
                <li>The buyer received the incorrect quantity of items (e.g., the buyer purchased three items but only received two).</li>
                <li>The item was advertised as authentic but is not authentic.</li>
                <li>The condition of the item is misrepresented (e.g., the item is described as new but is used).</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Not as Described cases can also be filed for late delivery. In order to qualify as late delivery, the buyer must provide proof that all of these conditions have been met:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>The item(s) were ordered for a specific date or event.</li>
                <li>The item(s) are rendered useless after that date.</li>
                <li>The seller did not dispatch the item(s) according to their processing time or the date agreed upon in messages.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>If Sosh determines that an item is not as described, you will be required to refund the order, including original postage and return postage.</p>
            <h3>Ineligible Transactions</h3>
            <p>Some disputes don’t qualify for Sosh’s case system. These include:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Items that are damaged by the delivery carrier (if properly packaged by the seller).</li>
                <li>Items that have been altered, used, worn, washed, or discarded after receipt.</li>
                <li>Items that are received after the agreed-upon delivery date due to delivery delays.</li>
                <li>Items that are returned without a return agreement.</li>
                <li>Items that are accurately described but don’t meet a buyer's expectations.</li>
                <li>Cost of postage disputes.</li>
                <li>Items that are purchased in person.</li>
                <li>Items prohibited from sale on Sosh, including services and intangible goods.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>When a dispute is ineligible for our case system, we encourage both parties to work together to come to an amicable solution.</p>
            
            <br>
            <p>If Sosh has reason to believe you, Your Content, or your use of the Services violate our Terms, including this Seller Policy, we may deactivate Your Content or suspend or terminate your account (and any accounts Sosh determines is related to your account) and your access to the Services. Generally, Sosh will notify you that Your Content or account has been suspended or terminated, unless you’ve repeatedly violated our Terms or we have legal or regulatory reasons preventing us from notifying you.</p>
